#Portfolio

This is a non-production copy of the project repository. Check it out live @ www.connorgillis.me
Note: settings.py has been modified. Google API keys, email server information, and django secret-keys have been removed or set as env. variables for the time being until I can append integration instructions into this readme. 

## Overview

While I like to think I'm pretty adaptable with web frameworks, my favorite by far is Django. This probably goes without saying but I happen to have the most experience with Python as a programming language in general and Django as a framework. Given the above statement, I felt that the most important and exemplary portfolio piece I have ought to be the portfolio itself. I put a lot of work into making sure this app was designed properly and would allow me deliver dynamic content after deployment.

The web application runs Django and is hosted in a scalable Heroku environment. One of the main compoents with this site is the portfolio aspect. Enter: Wagtail CMS. Wagtail is a Django Content Management System. Wagtail is "built by developers for developers". This sounded pretty appropriate. My Heroku envionrment for this project also contains my PostgreSQL database. Media files - like the ones you see in the image carousel above - are hosted and served by Google Cloud Platform.

Creating this site from development to production was a bit of a journey but I'm happy to have a platform to be able to share my projects and future ideas. Below you can take a look at some images
